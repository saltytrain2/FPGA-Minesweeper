# FPGA-Minesweeper

A implementation of minesweeper for EEECE 4377 in VHDL

## Required Peripherals/Software
  - Intel Quartus Prime
  - DE2-115 Development Board
  - Mouse with PS2 Interface
  - VGA Display

## Installation

This project was compelted in Quartus. To ease with version control, this repository contains only the VHDL development files. To build this project, please set up a Quartus 
project with the developent board set to a DE2-115. Once the project is set up, clone this repository into the quartus project, set Top_Level.vhd as the top-entity, and build
